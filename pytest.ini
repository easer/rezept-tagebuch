# Markers
markers =
    crud: CRUD operation tests (create, read, update, delete)
    integration: Integration tests requiring running container
    e2e: End-to-end tests
    slow: Slow running tests

# Minimum Python version
minversion = 3.11

# SQLite Configuration:
# SQLite doesn't handle concurrent writes well, causing "database is locked" errors
# Tests run sequentially to avoid this issue (not a production problem, only affects tests)
